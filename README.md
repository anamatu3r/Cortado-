It's been done: The Final 1.0 Release. This project was immensely hard, but it has been finished: Cortado#.

All major updates from now on will be seperated into another branch. After 3 branches have been created, it will merge into the main branch.


This project is a revision of Prism Interpreter called Cortado#. Cortado# follows in the direction of a programming language, but certainly not as advanced as one, so this is still under the category of a very, very simple interpreter. ;)
