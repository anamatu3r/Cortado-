WIP Stage: Coding more syntax

More syntax has been coded, what is left are arithmitic operations and if statements

This project is work in progress! The final expected release date is Feburary/March.

THis projects is a revision of Prism Interpreter called Cortado#. Cortado# follows in the direction of a programming language, but certaintly not as advanced as one, so this is still under the category of a very, very simple interpreter. ;)
